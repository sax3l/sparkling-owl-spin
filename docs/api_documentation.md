# API Documentation

This document provides details about the REST and GraphQL APIs.

## REST API

The REST API is defined using the OpenAPI specification. You can find the interactive documentation at the `/docs` endpoint when the application is running.

The OpenAPI specification file is located at `docs/openapi.yaml`.

## GraphQL API

The GraphQL API provides a flexible way to query data. The schema is available at the `/graphql` endpoint, which also serves a GraphiQL interface for interactive queries.

The GraphQL schema definition is located at `docs/graphql.graphql`.
