# API Migration Guides

This directory contains guides for migrating between different versions of the ECaDP API.

When a new major version of the API is released (e.g., `/v1` to `/v2`), or when significant breaking changes are introduced, a migration guide will be provided here.

Each guide will detail:
-   The changes introduced in the new version.
-   How to migrate your existing integrations to use the new version.
-   Any new features or improvements.
-   The deprecation schedule for older versions or deprecated fields.
