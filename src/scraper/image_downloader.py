This module will handle the downloading of media files like images and PDFs.
It will include features like rate limiting, checksum validation (hashing),
deduplication, and storing files in an object storage (e.g., S3/GCS),
with references stored in the database.

This corresponds to the requirements outlined in "Media & filer" (Kapitel 6.9).
