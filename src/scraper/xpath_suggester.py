This module will contain the logic for automatically suggesting robust XPath and CSS
selectors by analyzing multiple pages of the same template. It will implement
techniques like DOM-klustring, variance analysis, and stability scoring as
outlined in the project documentation (Kapitel 6.4).

The goal is to automate the "variabel matchning & mönsterdetektion" process.
