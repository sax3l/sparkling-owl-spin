# Make request (challenges solved automatically)
response = scraper.get('https://protected-site.com')
print(response.status_code)  # 200
```

Advanced Configuration:
```python
scraper = create_scraper(
    solver_preference=['node', 'browser', 'flaresolverr'],
    rotate_user_agents=True,
    min_request_interval=1.0,
    browser_headless=True,
    flaresolverr={{'endpoint': 'http://localhost:8191'}}
)
```

Token Extraction:
```python
cookies, user_agent = scraper.get_tokens('https://site.com')
cookie_string, ua = scraper.get_cookie_string('https://site.com')
```

üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
