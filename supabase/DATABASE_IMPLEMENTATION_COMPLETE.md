## Deployment Instructions

1. **Local Development with Docker**:
   ```bash
   # Run the migrations in order
   cd supabase
   npx supabase db reset
   ```

2. **Supabase Cloud**:
   - Upload migration files to your Supabase project
   - Migrations will run automatically in sequence

3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```sql
   -- Check that all migrations completed
   SELECT * FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations;
   
   -- Verify seed data
   SELECT COUNT(*) as role_count FROM user_roles;
   SELECT COUNT(*) as queue_count FROM job_queues;
   SELECT COUNT(*) as rule_count FROM data_quality_rules;
   ```
